  Hello! I am a PhD student in Computer Science at <a  href="https://www.cornell.edu/"  target="_blank">Cornell University</a>, where I am advised by Prof. <a  href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~shmat/"  target="_blank">Vitaly Shmatikov</a>. Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies at <a  href="https://www.virginia.edu/"  target="_blank">University of Virginia</a>, working under the guidance of Prof. <a  href="https://www.ytian.info/"  target="_blank">Yuan Tian</a> and Prof. <a  href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/"  target="_blank">David Evans</a>. My current research focuses on the security and privacy aspects of machine learning.
